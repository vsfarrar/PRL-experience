Issues: Need to fill in blanks of sex and experience in this dataset. 
Is this all the birds culled for covid19?
What about chicks and fledge rates?

```{r data import}
#import data 
dat <-read.csv("~/Documents/projects/PRL_experience/prl_experience_brains_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

#cleanup data
dat <-
dat %>%
  mutate_at(funs(as.numeric), .vars = vars(nest_count:age_years)) %>% #convert to numeric for binning
  mutate(sex =  case_when(grepl("m", sex) ~ "m", #clean up sex data for readability
                            grepl("f", sex) ~"f"))

```

```{r sample sizes}
#sample size
colnames(dat)

dat %>%
  group_by(experience,sex) %>%
  tally()

#experienced birds: ranges of nest counts 
dat %>%
  filter(experience == "y") %>%
  group_by(nest_no = cut(nest_count, breaks = seq(0,30,10)), sex) %>%
  tally()

#inexperienced birds by age
dat %>%
  drop_na(age_years) %>%
  filter(experience == "n") %>%
  group_by(sex, age = cut(age_years, breaks = seq(0,4,0.5))) %>%
  tally()
```
```{r}
#experienced birds: by nest no and age 
dat %>%
  drop_na(age_years)%>%
  filter(experience == "y") %>%
  group_by(nest_no = cut(nest_count, breaks = seq(0,30,10)), age = cut(age_years, breaks = seq(0,4,1))) %>%
  tally()
```
